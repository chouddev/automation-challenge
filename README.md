## What is this?
A set of take-home questions to assess your technical skills with Cypress. After cloning and setting yourself up, you
will have a small scale web application against which you will write test assertions. Step by step instructions will introduce
you to common situations we are currently facing at work.  

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important 
Submit answers that YOU think are the most relevant, there is NO right or wrong answers!

## What's next?
Follow these steps to get a local version of this project:

npm ci

# Start the webapp (macOS/Linux)
npm run start

# Start the webapp (Windows)

## Criteria you will be judged on:
- **Completion of Section 1**
- **Optional completion of Section 2**
- Overall structure of the presented code
- Proper usage of page objects
- Testing problems are green and asserting the right scenarios

## Ran all the tests and everything is passing except the download one from Section2.(Error is related to a node module path-browserify, If I get some free time today I might come back and fix it)
